## About the Game

**Protocol-Escape Game** is a virtual reality (VR) escape room game built using the [L√ñVR](https://lovr.org/) framework and Lua scripting. As an indie developer, I, **Axlfc**, designed this game to provide an immersive and extensible VR experience, packed with intriguing puzzles and a modular architecture for scalability.

## Architecture

The game's architecture is organized into several components:

1. **Core**
    - `main.lua`: Entry point managing the game lifecycle.
2. **Controllers**
    - `sceneManager.lua`: Handles scenes and transitions.
    - `gameController.lua`: Manages game logic and player actions.
3. **Models**
    - `gameState.lua`, `playerState.lua`: Track game and player states.
4. **Views**
    - `menuView.lua`, `hud.lua`: Render UI and HUD components.
5. **Entities**
    - `pawn.lua`, `character.lua`: Represent objects and players in the game.
6. **Utilities**
    - `eventDispatcher.lua`, `logger.lua`: Support debugging and event handling.
